# Realistic Manifesto

### Project Abstract

This project aims to express the spirit and ideas of The Realistic Manifesto (Gabo & Pevsner, 1920), a work widely regarded as the seminal text of Constructivism. The Constructivist movement revolved around an artistic philosophy concerned primarily with the intrinsic physical and spatial properties of objects.

The manifesto hails space and time as the governing aesthetic principles, asserting that they are the most useful in the artistic emulation of perceptual reality. The authors additionally specify depth and kinetic rhythm as the primary elements that support these principles. The manifesto renounces traditional aesthetic applications of color, line, volume, mass, and static rhythm in favor of the aforementioned elements and other strategies for representing space and time.

This web experience attempts to realize ideas presented in the "Realistic Manifesto" (Gabo & Pevsner, 1920) as an interactive kinetic sculpture. The five tenets of the manifesto may be read as display type set to utilize linear direction and depth to create an awareness of space. Various meshes that represent ideas in these tenets dynamically drift and rotate within three dimensions to aesthetically instantiate the notions of space and time. The user may navigate the environment (within limits) for a more visceral experience or allow the view to rest and observe the sculptural bodies drifting through space.

The scene (rendered with three.js) is the S. Mark Taper courtyard at California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, California.
